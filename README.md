# Project Title

This project counts on all the code for generating and plotting Dirichlet distributions and their related processes.
All the code is in: [GNU Octave](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) programming language for scientific computing.

## Getting Started

In order to obtain the code of the project in your local machine,
type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied from this repository.

$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Since the code in this repository is written in [GNU Octave](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/)
which is an interpreted language, you won't need to compile the soft in order to run it.
To run this soft you need to have [GNU Octave](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) installed
in your machine and [statistics package](https://octave.sourceforge.io/statistics/index.html).
That's all.

## Running the tests

This repository has a function called Dirichlet\_plots which
produces plots of Beta and Dirichlet distribution with parameter
\alpha.
```
Dirichlet\_plots([1 1 1])
Dirichlet\_plots([10 10 10])
Dirichlet\_plots([10 10 10])
Dirichlet\_plots([2 5 25])
Dirichlet\_plots([0.2 0.2 0.2])
```
The Beta distribution takes the two first
components from \alpha

In order to generate plots from Dirichlet samples generated from the soft
we can use Polya's method in the following way:

```
octave:14> tic(); Plot\_Dir\_dist\_points([10 10 10]',"polya",50,10); toc()
Elapsed time is 1.09946 seconds.
octave:15> figure; tic(); Plot\_Dir\_dist\_points([10 10 10]',"polya",50,100); toc()
Elapsed time is 10.6354 seconds.
octave:16> figure; tic(); Plot\_Dir\_dist\_points([10 10 10]',"polya",50,1000); toc()
Elapsed time is 90.3149 seconds.
octave:17> close all
octave:18>
```
If you want to plot samples generated by stick-breaking and Gamma methods
you can run the following script lines.

```
octave:45> tic(); Plot_Dir_dist_points([10 10 10]',"stick",500); toc()
Elapsed time is 1.30562 seconds.
octave:46> tic(); Plot_Dir_dist_points([10 10 10]',"gamm",500); toc()
Elapsed time is 0.860974 seconds.
octave:47>
```

If you want to plot the statistics generated from a realization from
the Dirichlet process by means of the Chinese restaurant process
you can run the following lines.

```
octave:64> tic(), Plot_Dir_proc_points(1,"chinese",10000); toc()
Elapsed time is 8.75048 seconds.
octave:65> tic(), Plot_Dir_proc_points(10,"chinese",10000); toc()
Elapsed time is 11.2502 seconds.
octave:66> tic(), Plot_Dir_proc_points(100,"chinese",10000); toc()
Elapsed time is 11.8098 seconds.
octave:67> tic(), Plot_Dir_proc_points(1000,"chinese",10000); toc()
Elapsed time is 11.072 seconds.
```
If you want to plot the statistics generated from a realization from
the Dirichlet process by means of the Polya's urn process
you can run the following lines.

First of all, you have to define a lambda function in Octave
in order to specify a distribution over partitions.

```
random_color = @() stdnormal_rnd(1);
```
This lambda function specify a standard normal distribution
over partitions.
Then you can run the following commands in Octave.


```
octave:70> tic(); Plot_Dir_proc_points(1,"polya",10000,random_color); toc()
Elapsed time is 8.88695 seconds.
octave:73> tic(); Plot_Dir_proc_points(10,"polya",10000,random_color); toc()
Elapsed time is 11.351 seconds.
octave:74> tic(); Plot_Dir_proc_points(100,"polya",10000,random_color); toc()
Elapsed time is 11.9943 seconds.
octave:75> tic(); Plot_Dir_proc_points(1000,"polya",10000,random_color); toc()
Elapsed time is 12.299 seconds.

```
In order to generate plots of realizations from the Dirichlet process from
the stick-breakng method you have to type the following lines of script code.

```
octave:125> subplot(2,2,1)
octave:126> tic(); Plot_Dir_proc_points(1,"stick",50); toc()
Elapsed time is 0.133269 seconds.
octave:127> subplot(2,2,2)
octave:128> tic(); Plot_Dir_proc_points(5,"stick",50); toc()
Elapsed time is 0.125743 seconds.
octave:129> subplot(2,2,3)
octave:130> tic(); Plot_Dir_proc_points(10,"stick",50); toc()
Elapsed time is 0.395299 seconds.
octave:131> subplot(2,2,4)
octave:132> tic(); Plot_Dir_proc_points(12,"stick",50); toc()
Elapsed time is 0.217011 seconds.
octave:133>
```
